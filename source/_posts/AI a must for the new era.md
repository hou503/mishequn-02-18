In 2016, the birth of AlphaGo kicked off a new wave of artificial intelligence. After nearly three decades of silence, artificial intelligence has finally ushered in a new spring.

Popularize the basics of Artificial Intelligence and take the first step to understanding it. Artificial intelligence is complex, but not mysterious. It is built on basic mathematics with linear algebra and probability theory as its backbone, and it performs complex functions through the combination of simple models. In engineering terms, deep neural networks are often prohibitive with their Ganges-like parameters; in theory, however, their mathematics is much more interpretable. While it takes an extraordinary mind to do high-end, multi-million-dollar-a-year research, understanding the fundamentals of AI is far from an unattainable dream.

The early development of AI followed the path of the semiotic school of thought, but its narrow field of application quickly led it to silence after a brief period of glory. Learning from the lessons of the symbolist school, the connectionist school simulated human intelligence by engineering technical means to simulate the structure and function of the human brain's nervous system. This line of thinking, to some extent, enables the function of the human brain's image mind and has become the core technology of today's artificial intelligence.

1. Mathematical Fundamentals. Mathematical fundamentals contain the basic ideas and methods for dealing with intelligence problems, and are essential elements for understanding complex algorithms. In this module I will introduce the mathematical fundamentals essential to the study of artificial intelligence, including linear algebra, probability theory, and optimization methods.

2. Machine Learning. The role of machine learning is to learn algorithms from data and then to solve practical application problems, which is one of the core goals of artificial intelligence. In this module I will introduce the main methods in machine learning, including linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and clustering.

3. Artificial Neural Networks. As a branch of machine learning, neural networks bring cognitive science into machine learning to simulate the interaction of the biological nervous system to the real world, with good results. In this module I will introduce the basic concepts in neural networks, including multilayer neural networks, feedforward and backpropagation, and self-organizing neural networks.

4. Deep Learning. In short, deep learning is a neural network containing multiple intermediate layers, and the rise of deep learning has been driven by the explosion of data and soaring computing power. In this module I will introduce the concept and implementation of deep learning, including deep feedforward networks, regularization in deep learning, autoencoders, and more.

5. Neural Network Examples. A number of neural networks have been used in a variety of application scenarios within the framework of deep learning and have achieved remarkable results. In this module I will introduce several neural network examples, including convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and deep belief networks.

6. Artificial Intelligence Beyond Deep Learning. Deep learning has both advantages and limitations, and other directions are useful additions to AI research. In this module I will introduce several learning methods that are not related to deep learning, including Markov random fields, migration learning, and cluster intelligence.

7. Application Examples. In addition to performing repetitive labor in place of humans, AI has provided meaningful attempts at solving many practical problems. In this module I will describe the application of AI technology to several types of practical tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, and conversational systems.

At the turn of the century it was popular to say that people who did not understand computers, foreign languages, and driving skills would be the illiterate people of the 21st century. And in the near future, AI is likely to become the new test of illiteracy.
